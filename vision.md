# Vision

We are an heterogeneous team with the same purpose: publish a working and easy-to-use version of NERVE. 
We met each other almost randomly, like in a _primordial broth_, and now we are planning to work together in order to complete this project.

Thanks to the collaboration it is possible to figure out what are the needs of the biologists that computer engineers can meet, while  only the firsts can provide the right knowledge to achieve this, like a _mutualistic symbiosis_.
