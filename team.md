# Team

We are an heterogeneous team with the same purpose: *publish a working and easy-to-use version of NERVE*. 

We met each other almost randomly, like in a primordial broth, and now we are planning to work together in order to complete this project.

Thanks to the collaboration it is possible to figure out what are the needs of the biologists that computer engineers can meet, while only the firsts can provide the right knowledge to achieve this, like a mutualistic symbiosis.

Currently, the following people are actively contributing to this project:

- Andrea Conte, MSc at University of Padua (Italy)
- [Nicola Gulmini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-gulmini-576924135/), research intern at [Tyndall National Institute](https://www.tyndall.ie/) / University College Cork (Ireland)
- [Francesco Costa](https://github.com/FranceCosta), research intern at [Khmelinskaia lab](https://www.limes-institut-bonn.de/en/research/research-departments/unit-4/khmelinskaia-lab/khmelinskaia-lab-home/), University of Bonn (Germany)
- [Matteo Cartura](https://it.linkedin.com/in/matteo-cartura-927799181), master's student at University of Padua
