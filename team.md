# Team

We are an heterogeneous team with the same purpose: **publish a working and easy-to-use version of NERVE**. 

We met each other almost randomly, like in a _primordial broth_, and now we are planning to work together in order to complete this project.

Thanks to the collaboration it is possible to figure out what are the needs of the biologists that computer engineers can meet, while only the firsts can provide the right knowledge to achieve this, like a _mutualistic symbiosis_.

Currently, the following people are actively contributing to this project:

- Andrea Conte, MSc in Industrial Biotechnology at University of Padua (Italy)
- [Felix Br√∂hl](https://broehl.dev/), master's student in Computer Science at University of Bonn (Germany)
- [Francesco Costa](https://github.com/FranceCosta), research intern at [Khmelinskaia lab](https://www.limes-institut-bonn.de/en/research/research-departments/unit-4/khmelinskaia-lab/khmelinskaia-lab-home/), University of Bonn
- [Matteo Cartura](https://it.linkedin.com/in/matteo-cartura-927799181), master's student in Industrial Biotechnology at University of Padua
- [Nicola Gulmini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-gulmini-576924135/), research intern at [Tyndall National Institute](https://www.tyndall.ie/), University College Cork (Ireland)
- [Prof. Francesco Filippini](https://www.biologia.unipd.it/en/department/people/teacher-details/?tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Baccount%5D=francesco-filippini), the supervisor of the project, Associate Professor at University of Padua
