## Welcome to NERVE project website!

NERVE (new enhanced reverse vaccinology environment) is an open-source tool to perform analyses on bacteria proteomes in order to get the best candidates to produce a vaccine. 
The project was initially developed in Perl, and it's still available for [download](http://www.bio.unipd.it/molbinfo/NERVE_download.html). Now, **independently** from the first developer, we are carrying on this project. 

You can find all the related information on the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570458/). A new paper, describing the new version of NERVE, will be published soon.
