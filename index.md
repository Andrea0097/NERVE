## Welcome to NERVE project website!

NERVE (_new enhanced reverse vaccinology environment_) is an open-source tool to perform analyses on bacteria proteomes in order to get the best candidates to produce a vaccine. 
The project was initially developed in Perl, and it's still available for [download](http://www.bio.unipd.it/molbinfo/NERVE_download.html). Now, **independently** from the first developer, we are carrying on this project.

You can find all the related information on the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570458/). A new paper, describing the new version of NERVE, will be published soon. 

### State of the work

- [x] rewrite the original program in Python
- [ ] update some modules with currently available tools
- [ ] implementing a public user-friendly colab version of the program

### Direction
There are so many things that could be done. For example, it would be interesting to extend the analysis including the genomic information instead of only proteome ones.

## Vision

## Team
