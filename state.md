# State of the work

- [x] rewrite the original program in Python
- [ ] update some modules with currently available tools
- [ ] implementing a public user-friendly colab version of the program

## Direction
There are so many things that could be done. 
For example, it would be interesting to extend the analysis including the genomic information instead of only proteome ones.
