# State of the work

- [x] translate the original program from Perl to Python
- [x] replace some outdated or deprecated modules with updated ones
- [x] replace some modules adding machine-learning-based ones, avoiding external dependencies
- [x] implement a public user-friendly colab version of the program
- [ ] write and publish the paper
- [ ] future directions (?)

## Direction
There are so many things that could be done or that we decided to ignore for the moment.
For example, it would be interesting to extend the domain of the program, introducing the possibility to add and analyze the genomic information, even for other organisms, not only for bacteria. 
Also, a properly programmed web version of the program could be more easy-accessible from the users.
